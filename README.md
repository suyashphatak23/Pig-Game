# Pig Game 🎲

A two-player dice game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How to Play

1. **Roll the dice** - Click "Roll dice" to roll. The number adds to your current score.
2. **Watch out for 1s** - If you roll a 1, you lose your current score and it's the other player's turn.
3. **Hold your score** - Click "Hold" to bank your current score and pass the turn.
4. **Win the game** - First player to reach 100 points wins!

## Game Rules

- Two players take turns
- On your turn, roll as many times as you want to accumulate points
- Rolling a 1 forfeits all points from that turn
- Click "Hold" to safely add your current points to your total score
- The game ends when a player reaches 100 points

## Running the Game

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser - no installation required.
